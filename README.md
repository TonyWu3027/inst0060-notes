# inst0060-notes
Lecture notes for INST0060 Foundation of Machine Learning and Data Science module, taught at the Department of Information Studies, University College London (UCL). 

## Credit
The notes are based on lectures of the lecturer _Dr Luke Dickens_ at the Department of Information Studies, University College London (UCL). Some figures are screenshots of his lectures slides.

## Structure
`./md/`: the original `.md` files of the notes. Note that the `.md` files are created with _Typora_ with _LaTeX_ embedded, which is not rendered on Github, refer to `.pdf` files for mathematical expressions. 

`./src/`: the directory for attached pictures

`./pdf/`: the exported `.pdf` files
