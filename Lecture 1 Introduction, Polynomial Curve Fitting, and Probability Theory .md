>   using Classifying Hand Written Digits as example

-   A training set of $N$ digits
-   Each digit, $i$, is an image, representing as an ***input vector of pixel values*** $x_i$
-   The category of each digit, $i$, is known and expresses as ***target vector*** $t_i$

-   ML algorithm outputs function $y(x)$, which can take new digit input $x$ and output vector $y$, which is a ***guess*** of the target $t$. The precise form of $y(x)$ is determined during the training phases.
-   The ability to categorise new examples that differ from those used for training is called ***generalisation***
